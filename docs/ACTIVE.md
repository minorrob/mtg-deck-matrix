# Who holds the work

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Holder** | Free — #341 to #348 all merged; nothing open |
| **Branch** | `main`; nothing open. **8768 is running this code** — restarted 2026-09-22 after the last merge, verified with a pod. It is **local-only**: relaunch through `start-crankmagic.ps1 -RemoteGuests` when remote guests are wanted. |
| **Since** | 2026-09-22 |
| **Doing** | **Stage A is complete, Stage B is seven of nine, and the play-audio track is finished.** The board is on the design tokens, laid out as the wireframe's 2×2, fits one screen with the hand, and plays the pack. Plans: `docs/plan-stage-b-board.md` (the frames, measured — and now measured again in a live game), `docs/plan-board-information-layer.md`, `docs/plan-card-extraction-skill.md`, `docs/plan-play-audio.md`, `docs/plan-web-to-local-table-2026-09-21.md` (planned, not started). |
| **Next for whoever picks this up** | **Two decisions are Rob's and nothing else is blocked.** B.6b's history band — re-proportion every board, or use the empty strip the mat art already prints over; the plan has both with their costs. And B.2b's light mat. After that, `docs/plan-web-to-local-table-2026-09-21.md` is five pieces, none of them started. Run a pod with `game/tools/qa-pod.mjs` before and after any board change. |

## Play audio, all five phases in

The pack Rob generated (`crankmagic2-play-audio-generated`, 88 files, 5.3 MB) is served by the
host and the gateway, and the board plays it. `docs/plan-play-audio.md` carries the detail; the
shape is three modules that do not know about each other.

| | |
|---|---|
| `play-audio-rules.mjs` | R1–R7 and R13 as pure functions of a type line. Has never heard of a speaker |
| `play-audio.mjs` | Two Web Audio buses, lazy decode, crossfade. Context, fetch and storage injected, so it runs headless |
| `play-audio-events.mjs` | The feed → clip names. A second consumer of the same `recent` the notices read, with its own filter and its own `seen` set |
| `review.mjs` | The only place that knows about all three: arms, pumps, chooses a bed, draws the sliders |

**The gesture is the whole difficulty**, and it is worth knowing before touching this: a browser
refuses to play anything on a page nobody has clicked, and refuses *silently*. The context is
therefore built and resumed **synchronously inside the first `pointerdown`** — one `await` before
that call and the permission is gone with no error anywhere.

**It has been heard in a real game.** A two-seat match against the native Forge AI, driven from a
browser: the lobby bed, the game bed crossfading in when the table went live, the viewer's own
draw, a land, a permanent arriving, and the combat bed at the first `COMBAT_` step — with no page
errors. Engine event → journal → `match-telemetry` → `play-audio-events` → `play-audio` → network,
all of it.

**Three clips can never play**, and `UNREACHABLE_FROM_THE_FEED` in `play-audio-events.mjs` says
why, with a test that fails if a fourth one quietly joins them. `sfx_event_counterspell` needs a
telemetry row that does not exist (`GameEventSpellRemovedFromStack` reaches `public-stack.mjs` but
not `match-telemetry.mjs`); `sfx_event_equip` and `sfx_event_crew` need `CrankCardScript@1` from
the engine plan — the same dependency the two blocked board alerts wait on.

**Two claims in the plan were wrong and are struck through in it rather than footnoted.**
`GameEventTurnBegan` does not exist anywhere in this repository, and the countered-spell row never
reaches the feed. Both were ticked ✅ in the plan's own mapping table before anyone looked.

## Stage A, finished

Six of Rob's findings turned out to be one finding: **the board had the facts and never drew them.**

| | |
|---|---|
| A.1 | The lag measurement — which found the board was never connecting at all |
| A.2 | A spent prompt is not a decision. Forge never clears `prompt`, so `/^Priority:/` matched an answered string. `ui.inputType` is the fact to stand on |
| A.3 | `End game` and `Auto-pass turn` out of the action row |
| A.4 | The skipped first draw explained where the player was refused (CR 103.8a, two players only) |
| A.5 | **Answered from Rob's own match journal:** the starting player *does* draw in a four-player pod |
| A.6.1–4 | Notices with an OK button, history with the card and the reason, incoming damage where blocks are chosen, poison and your own draw |

## Stage B, against wireframes 2e and 2f

**The frames are numbers, not sketches** — React trees with inline styles, extracted once into
`docs/plan-stage-b-board.md` so nobody re-derives them. Drawn at half scale; double for the build.

| | |
|---|---|
| B.1 | The step strip — `Turn 4 · You`, brass step chip, `4 / 7`, **`Next: …`** |
| B.2 | Four **identical** 16:9 boards in one 2×2. Measured 584×329 each at three widths |
| B.3 | The center counter — 152px, four totals on their own `--seat` colors, the disc cycles life → commander damage → poison |
| B.4 | The hand on the mat's bottom edge. **Zero overlap**, tested with real-sized cards |
| B.5a | The panel slides **over** the mat; the mat stays 1368px whether it is open or shut |
| B.6a | The mat stops printing the steps list and the life box — B.1 and B.3 carry both now. **Seen working with cards** |
| B.6c | The other three boards as a left pane in Focus, with Table view and a collapse. **Seen working with cards** |

### The board has now been seen with cards, and it was wrong in two ways

`game/tools/qa-pod.mjs` starts a pod against the native Forge AI, plays it far enough that the
boards have something on them, photographs it and measures it. **Three Stage B pieces were blocked
for a week on the sentence "cannot be judged without cards on screen"; they are not blocked any
more.** Run it against a second host on a spare port unless the one in use is idle:

```
node game/tools/qa-pod.mjs --out shots/ --port 8778 --turns 3
```

The first run found both of these, and no CSS-shape suite could have:

- **The hand was 500px below the fold** at 1920×1080. A card is *dragged* from the hand onto a
  mat, so a hand off screen is not a cosmetic problem. Fixed by bounding the mat by the viewport's
  height and taking its width from 16:9 — which is what `mats.css` already did for its own compact
  overview, so the approach had a precedent rather than being invented.
- **The counter sat on a player's own name**, because all four headings rode the top edge. Frame 2e
  had said how to avoid that (`column-reverse` on the bottom row) and nothing had implemented it.

Both are in #347, and the harness reports the `fold` line, the audio clips a real game played and
the page-error count on every run.

### What is left, and why each one waits

- **B.5b — the rail overlay.** `/review` is a standalone page. There is no CrankMagic rail on it to
  bring back, so the control would open an empty drawer. It arrives when the board becomes a view
  of the one app.
- **B.6b — the History band.** Not "add a band": 2f wants a real row between the zone pairs, and
  the mat's absolute layout has no gap there. It re-proportions every board's zones. **No longer
  blocked, and now measured** — the gap between the two pile pairs is 4.8% of the mat, about
  25px, and a band needs three times that. The plan carries the two ways to make the room and
  what each costs. **It is Rob’s call now, not a measurement question.**
- **B.6d — the Coach.** Not to be built until it works. 2f draws it and says "its logic is a later
  phase"; Rob's standing rule (2026-09-22) is that nothing is available before it is functional, so
  the surface waits for the logic rather than arriving ahead of it.
- **B.2b — the light mat.** The frame draws the play surface cream (`#e9e4da`) under dark chrome.
  **Rob's call, deliberately untouched** — it changes the whole feel and carries a raw-hex cost.

## Three limits found by measuring, which the next person should not re-discover

**The adapter reports exactly nine keywords** — flying, reach, trample, first strike, double
strike, deathtouch, lifelink, infect, wither (`ForgeProbe.java:241`). Menace, protection,
indestructible, shadow and fear never leave the engine. Widening it is a Java change and a rebuild.

**Forge can take back mana but never a land.** `setUndoable(true)` is called in exactly two places,
both mana effects, and `recordUndoableActions()` is reached only from `MagicStack.add()`, which a
land play never touches. That is CR 305.1 rather than an omission, and it is why the control is
called "Take mana back" instead of "Undo".

**Two of Rob's alerts need card text, not events** — "exiled with a return condition" and "a
mechanic triggered by other players". They are the first consumer of the card extraction skill, and
`docs/plan-card-extraction-skill.md` is the design: emit `CrankCardScript@1` (#305 §3.4) so one
artifact serves the pilot now and the engine later.

## Standing facts

- The host serves `game/ui/*` **per request**, so UI changes land on reload. Anything the host
  *imports* — `serve-review.mjs`, `game/server/*`, `match-telemetry.mjs`, the launcher — needs a
  restart. A **new** file in the served map needs one too, so import new `game/ui` modules
  optionally (`await import(...).catch(...)`), the way `review.mjs` already does.
- **`COMMANDER_GUEST_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` does not keep a tunnel alive; it only changes what the host
  SAYS.** This note used to read "every restart preserved `medium-linking-replies-take` that way",
  and on 2026-09-22 that address no longer resolved at all — `curl` could not even find it in DNS,
  while the gateway itself answered `200` on `127.0.0.1:8769`. Passing a stale origin back is
  therefore **worse than not passing it**: the lobby offers remote invitations that lead nowhere,
  instead of saying plainly that this host is local-only.
  The host does not run `cloudflared`; `game/tools/start-crankmagic.ps1 -RemoteGuests` does. So a
  plain `node game/tools/serve-review.mjs` has no tunnel and should not claim one. **Check the
  address answers from outside before passing it back**, and relaunch through the script when
  remote guests are actually wanted.
- The adapter is compiled by the launcher at every game start, so a Java change needs no build
  step — but it fails at game start rather than in a test, so compile it against the pinned jar
  before committing.
- `tools/board-latency.mjs` and `tools/first-draw-check.mjs` are read-only and safe against a live
  game. Neither invents a verdict it did not observe.
