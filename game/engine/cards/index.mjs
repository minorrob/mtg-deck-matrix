/* THE CARD DIRECTORY: WHAT THE ENGINE KNOWS ABOUT A CARD BY NAME.
 *
 * `docs/engine/PLAN.md` §3.1 and §6's phase 2.4 -- "`cards/index.mjs` with `resolve` and `suggest`", the same shape
 * as `forge-card-index.mjs`, reading CrankMagic's own definitions instead of Forge's scripts. Definitions live beside
 * it as `game/engine/cards/<letter>/<slug>.json` (`CrankCardScript@1`), each with its `<slug>.scenarios.json`;
 * `game/tools/engine-cards.mjs` reads them from disk, and this file, which touches no file system, is what a Worker
 * can import.
 *
 * A SCRIPT IS NOT YET AN OBJECT. The script says what the card says, in the vocabulary a model can be held to
 * ("enters", "upkeep", `{atom: "{T}"}`); the rules modules act on objects in their own terms (a trigger watching
 * `GameEventCardChangeZone`, a mana ability that `produces`). `compileScript` is the translation, and the only one:
 *   - a spell ability becomes the object's `spell`, which stack.mjs resolves;
 *   - "{T}: Add {G}" -- an activated ability with `{T}` as its whole cost, one fixed `addMana` and no target -- becomes
 *     a mana ability (CR 605.1a), which never uses the stack;
 *   - every other activated ability stays activated, and actions.mjs offers it;
 *   - a triggered ability's event is compiled to the engine event trigger.mjs watches;
 *   - keyword abilities become the object's keywords, in the rules modules' spelling;
 *   - statics and replacements pass through: their schema was written against layers.mjs and replacement.mjs.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT PLAY, IT SAYS, BY NAME, BEFORE THE GAME (decision M4, 2026-09-25: "refused by name"). A script can
 * be perfectly valid and still use something the engine has not built -- a primitive declared and not implemented,
 * a keyword with no behavior, a cost atom nothing pays, a trigger whose targets nothing chooses yet. Each is a
 * PROBLEM, and a card with any problem has no definition: `definition(name)` is null and `problems(name)` says why.
 * A table refuses it at prepare, never on the turn it is drawn.
